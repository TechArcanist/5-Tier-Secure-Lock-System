## üîí 5-Tier Secure Lock System

The **5-Tier Secure Lock System** is a robust security project that combines multiple layers of authentication for ultimate safety. This system uses a solenoid lock that requires the user to pass through multiple authentication layers, including a normal passcode, RFID, fingerprint scanning, OTP, and Google Authenticator-based OTP.

---

## Key Features

- **Solenoid Lock Mechanism:** The main locking mechanism that is activated after passing all security layers.
- **Passcode Authentication:** The first layer of security, where users must input a correct passcode.
- **RFID Authentication:** The second layer, using RFID technology for proximity-based authentication.
- **Fingerprint Authentication:** The third layer, requiring biometric verification using a fingerprint sensor.
- **OTP Layer:** The fourth layer sends an OTP to a registered mobile number for enhanced security.
- **Google Authenticator OTP:** The final layer that uses time-based OTP from Google Authenticator for maximum protection.

## üì¶ Components Used

- **ESP32 (Microcontroller)**
- **Solenoid Lock**
- **Relay Module** (to control the solenoid lock)
- **Keypad** (for passcode input)
- **RFID Reader Module** (for RFID authentication)
- **Fingerprint Sensor** (for biometric scanning)
- **Buzzer** (for alerts/feedback)
- **OLED/LCD Display** (for displaying system status)
- **Wi-Fi Module** (for OTP communication)
- **Google Authenticator API**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Passcode Layer:**  
   The system prompts the user to enter a passcode via the keypad. Upon correct entry, it moves to the next layer.
   
2. **RFID Layer:**  
   The user must scan their RFID tag. If the scanned ID matches the pre-stored authorized tag, it proceeds to the next layer.
   
3. **Fingerprint Layer:**  
   A fingerprint scan is required for biometric authentication. If the fingerprint matches the authorized data, the next step is triggered.
   
4. **OTP Layer:**  
   An OTP is sent to the registered phone number. The user must input the OTP correctly to proceed.
   
5. **Google Authenticator Layer:**  
   The final security layer prompts the user to provide a time-based OTP generated by the Google Authenticator app. Once authenticated, the solenoid lock is triggered to unlock.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Component Setup

- Connect the solenoid lock to the relay.
- Hook up the RFID reader, fingerprint sensor, and keypad to the ESP32.
- Integrate the display for status updates.
- Set up the Google Authenticator API for time-based OTP validation.

## üîß Upload Code

- Use Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.

## üîë Configure OTP

- Set up OTP messaging or use the Google Authenticator for time-based authentication.

## üìã Usage

- **User Registration:** Register users with passcode, RFID tags, and fingerprint data.
- **Security Activation:** When a user interacts with the system, it follows the sequence: passcode ‚Üí RFID ‚Üí fingerprint ‚Üí OTP ‚Üí Google Authenticator OTP.
- **Unlocking the Lock:** Upon successful completion of all layers, the solenoid lock is activated, and the door unlocks.
